/**
 * Root composable for the Fuse game. Entry point for both Android and iOS.
 *
 * UIB-3 made this the **playable game**; SHL-1 launched into [HomeScreen] with a temporary
 * hand-rolled switch. SHL-2 replaces that switch with **real Compose-Multiplatform navigation**
 * (see [AppShell]).
 *
 * The screen tree is wrapped in [FuseTheme] (dark) so the design tokens drive its colors. The
 * Koin graph must already be started (each app shell calls `initKoin()`) before this composable
 * runs, because [GameScreen] injects its store via `koinInject()` and [AppShell] resolves the
 * shared [GameStore] here.
 *
 * ## FEL-8 — the single reduced-motion switch
 * This is the ONE place the app-wide reduced-motion setting feeds the theme. We resolve
 * [ReducedMotionSettings] (default-OFF) from Koin and pass its flag into
 * `FuseTheme(reducedMotion = …)`. `FuseTheme` maps `reducedMotion = true` → it provides
 * `FuseMotion.Reduced` through `LocalFuseMotion`, so every FEL-1..7 animation collapses. Because
 * [ReducedMotionSettings.reducedMotionEnabled] is Compose-state-backed and read here inside
 * composition, flipping it (the SHL-3 settings toggle) recomposes `App()` and re-themes everything
 * LIVE, with no app restart.

/**
 * SHL-2 — the app shell as a real **Compose-Multiplatform navigation graph**.
 *
 * ## Navigation mechanism — JetBrains AndroidX Navigation Compose (multiplatform)
 * A [NavHost] over a [rememberNavController] with three argument-free destinations
 * ([FuseDestinations.HOME] / [FuseDestinations.GAME] / [FuseDestinations.SETTINGS]). This is the
 * idiomatic CMP nav primitive (real back stack, `navigate`/`popBackStack`) and — the crux of
 * SHL-2 — it integrates the platform back automatically:
 *  - **Android:** the `NavHost` registers with the `OnBackPressedDispatcher`, so the system /
 *    predictive back pops the nav back stack (Game→Home, Settings→Home) and, at the Home root,
 *    falls through to the default behaviour (exit the app). No `BackHandler` of our own is needed.
 *  - **iOS:** UIKit has no hardware back, so each non-root screen exposes an **in-screen** back
 *    affordance (Game's "‹ Home", Settings' "‹ Home") wired to [NavHostController.popBackStack];
 *    that is the single coherent back on iOS. (The same in-screen buttons also work on Android,
 *    in addition to system back.)
 *
 * ## Wiring
 *  - Home: `onPlayClassic → navigate(GAME)`, `onOpenSettings → navigate(SETTINGS)`. `onOpenDaily`
 *    stays a no-op placeholder (Daily = Sprint 5).
 *  - Game / Settings: their `onBack` calls `popBackStack()` (reconciling SHL-1's standalone
 *    "‹ Home" button into the nav-driven back — one back affordance, not two).
 *
 * ## In-progress game survives navigation
 * The [GameStore] is a Koin **singleton** holding the live game state, resolved once here and passed
 * straight into [GameScreen]. Navigating Home↔Game does NOT recreate or reset it: the destination's
 * composable is torn down/rebuilt but the store (hence board + score) is untouched, so a started game
 * is exactly where the player left it on return. Nothing in the nav layer calls `NewGame`.
 *
 * ## Best score stays fresh automatically
 * Home's best is read from the same shared store's `state` `StateFlow` (`bestScore`), collected here.
 * Because the store is the single source of truth and persists/raises best after every accepted move,
 * popping back to Home re-renders it with the up-to-date best with no manual refresh.
